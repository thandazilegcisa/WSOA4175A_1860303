          <h1>What is Decolonisation?</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            To answer this i would like to first point the compound expression
            that Mingnolo & Walsh introduce: The colonial matrix of power. They
            define this matrix as the convergence of modernity and coloniality.
            And considering the fact that this matrix of power is plural in
            nature they consider it important that readers, seek to define what
            decolonisation means to them. This is particularly interesting
            because by so doing they priortise geo-political relative truths,
            instead of an absolute truth about what decolonisation means to the
            formerly colonised. This is important because this signifies the
            ideals of decoloniality, which is to not only consider absolute
            truths presented by western civilisations as valid but instead
            consider other ways and forms of cultivating knowledge, without
            necessary eliminating and blindly accepting western thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where the idea of modernity comes in, this considers that
            western thought and civilisation through the lens of modernity is in
            most of us. Therefore, for me considering my geo-political standing
            in modern day South Afrcia. I would like to discuss and explore
            decolonisation through the lens of cultural heritage in an effor to
            see myself clearly. Now since the dawn colonisation, separation,
            segregation acts defined the mobility of the formerly colonised. And
            subsequently since the dawn of the industrial revolution the
            migration to urban centers and towns/townships away form traditional
            homesteads has brought about elements of modernity into the South
            African lives. And considering that modernity is a way of living it
            means that it is a practice and custom.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put this convergence into perspective i will use the following
            example. In Xhosa tradition boys ordained into manhood by performing
            traditional method of circumcision that is a part of a whole
            ceremony that is not just exclusive to circumcision but other
            beliefs and customs, although this project will not necessary
            discuss these practices. I only seek to highlight how the modernity
            of daily life and use of modern medicine (Anesthetics) results/
            could potentially result in being othered by the people of the
            culture despite sharing the same heritage and language,thus because
            of this element of modernity and coloniality, in the face of culture
            one would not be seen as a true Xhosa man.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in light of this i though it would be interesting to interrogate
            the act of "seeing myself clearly" in relation to otherselves with
            whom we share the universe and particularly culture for this
            project. Because with the example in consideration i am in a
            position where i am modernised and colonised by the practices that
            i've taken and not taken in the view of culture. And consequently i
            cannot necessary eliminate my modernity. Therefore, decolonisation
            becomes a very important concept/practice to consider, and as such
            since this perspective is about culture and heritage, I will
            interrogate decolonisation from the perspective of participating in
            practicing art as heritage through and on the internet.
