          <h1>A Formal Analysis of Click Club</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Net Art much like the internet is no singular and obsolete object.
            Insead it is plural, it can come in the form of using the internet
            as means to curate interaction and how an artwork is experienced.
            Hence, Click Club is an art project by Peter Luining, that consists
            of a webpage with a block of 3 rows of images that all link to new
            pages with animations,images, interactive pages. Elements of this
            art work particularly reminds me of the story of the library of
            babel.In the book, the authour writes about a universe if books that
            has been and will be created. The library of babel has no limits,
            which is indicated in the why click club structures how it exhibits
            the aura of the artwork. The artwork almost feels as though it is
            endless, which exemplifies the very medium that the creator uses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each click feels like and adventure into the unknown which sort of
            the artwork as a type of point and click adventure artwork that uses
            only a collage of images instead of text in this case. Therefore,
            the artwork from my perspective satirises the internet and things
            that could be viewed as click bait. Click bait is content whose main
            intent is to distract or attract attention and encourage visitors to
            click on a link to a particular page, which reinforces the idea of
            "adventure" envisioned through the art work.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the artwork makes use of a weakly interactive input -
            clicking and despite this it still manages to add a bit of
            randomness through the use of its on hover function which makes for
            good click bait, because most click baits eventually send you into a
            rabitt hole of "content" that you did not even ask for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, what makes Click Club interesting is how it uses the
            affordances provided by the browser and sort of signifying its own
            domain. I particularly liked all the gifs and animations used
            throughout the website because it also exmplifies the how gifs and
            memes are the vernacular of the internet, which is why i am able to
            deduce the kind of connotations that i now present. Because if the
            artwork was static it probably would'nt have signified the same
            representations.
